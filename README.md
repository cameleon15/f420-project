# Undecidability of Wang domino problem
*Project realized for the course of Computational Geometry (INFO-F420) by Camille Leduc*

This project's purpose is to show a reduction from a Turing machine to a Wang tiles and then restrain the tiles to only 5. The last reduction was unfortunately not done.
